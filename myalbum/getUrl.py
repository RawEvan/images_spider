this file connects the spider and the view which
change class to dict or list,
this is unnecessary when 'mySpider.py' was changed to
return a list of Dict
----
use this again to connect to storage and keep server files seperated

Don't store infomation to sql or storage, and use original url directly.
This file seems unnecessary now, just leave it waitting for other use.
